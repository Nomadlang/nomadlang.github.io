			<h1> Nomad </h1>
			<h3> Types without Borders </h3>
			<p> Nomad is a modern, multi-paradigm language designed to be simple.
				Nomad is inspired by ML and TypeScript and simplifies the concepts
				of these languages, so new features can be added. <p>

			<h3> Type System </h3>
			<p> Nomad's type system is based on a lattice. This lattice structure 
			    enables a highly flexible system. Types can be specialized or generalized
			    safely and automatically. This means that interface with types from other
			    languages is easy and fun.

			<h3> Syntax </h3>
			<p> Nomad is simple and designed to be approachable. 
			It supports both an ML style syntax:
			</p>
			<pre>
				double a: Float -> Float 
				double a = a + a
			</pre>
			<p>As well as a C style syntax</p>
			<pre>
				double(a: Float): Float => a + a
			</pre>
